 Biological nervous system is the most important part of many
 living things, in particular, human beings.
 There is a part called brain at the center of human nervous
 system.
 In fact, any biological nervous system consists of a large number
 of interconnected processing units called neurons.
 Each neuron is approximately 10m long and they can operate in
 parallel.
 Typically, a human brain consists of approximately 1011 neurons
 communicating with each other with the help of electrical
 impulses.
